# DocuBot
Talk to your PDFs like never before ‚Äî powered by HuggingFace, LangChain, and Streamlit.


An AI-powered PDF chatbot that allows users to upload one or more PDFs and ask questions based on the document content. Built with Streamlit, LangChain, HuggingFace Transformers, and Chroma vector database.

## üìÇ How It Works

1. **PDF Upload**  
   Users upload one or more PDF files through the Streamlit UI.

2. **Text Extraction**  
   `PyPDF2` extracts text from all pages.

3. **Chunking**  
   Text is split into manageable chunks using `CharacterTextSplitter`.

4. **Embedding & Vector Storage**  
   Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using HuggingFace and stored in Chroma DB.

5. **User Q&A**  
   Questions are processed, relevant chunks are retrieved, and a HuggingFace model (`flan-t5-base`) generates contextual answers.
